// Package winmanifest provides a basic manifest for use with
// package ui. You import it for its side effects only, as
// 
// 	import _ "github.com/andlabs/ui/winmanifest"
// 
// On non-Windows platforms this package does nothing.
// 
// If you intend on using a custom manifest instead of the generic
// one in this package, be sure to read package ui's README so your
// manifest can have the directives necessary for package ui to work.
