package ui

// Go sets up the UI environment and runs main in a goroutine.
// If initialization fails, Go returns an error and main is not called.
// Otherwise, Go does not return to its caller until (unless? TODO) the application loop exits, at which point it returns nil.
//
// This model is undesirable, but Cocoa limitations require it.
