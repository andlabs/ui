// Area represents a blank canvas upon which programs may draw anything and receive arbitrary events from the user.
// An Area has an explicit size, represented in pixels, that may be different from the size shown in its Window; Areas have horizontal and vertical scrollbars that are hidden when not needed.
// The coordinate system of an Area always has an origin of (0,0) which maps to the top-left corner; all image.Points and image.Rectangles sent across Area's channels conform to this.
// 
// To handle events to the Area, an Area must be paired with an AreaHandler.
// See AreaHandler for details.
// 
// Do not use an Area if you intend to read text.
// Area reads keys based on their position on a standard
// 101-key keyboard, and does no character processing.
// Character processing methods differ across operating
// systems; trying ot recreate these yourself is only going
// to lead to trouble.
// [Use TextArea instead, providing a TextAreaHandler.]
// 
// To facilitate development and debugging, for the time being, Areas only work on GTK+.
