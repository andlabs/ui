// Area is a Control that represents a blank canvas that a program
// can draw on as it wishes. Areas also receive keyboard and mouse
// events, and programs can react to those as they see fit. Drawing
// and event handling are handled through an instance of a type
// that implements AreaHandler that every Area has; see AreaHandler
// for details.
//
// There are two types of areas. Non-scrolling areas are rectangular
// and have no scrollbars. Programs can draw on and get mouse
// events from any point in the Area, and the size of the Area is
// decided by package ui itself, according to the layout of controls
// in the Window the Area is located in and the size of said Window.
// There is no way to query the Area's size or be notified when its
// size changes; instead, you are given the area size as part of the
// draw and mouse event handlers, for use solely within those
// handlers.
//
// Scrolling areas have horziontal and vertical scrollbars. The amount
// that can be scrolled is determined by the area's size, which is
// decided by the programmer (both when creating the Area and by
// a call to SetSize). Only a portion of the Area is visible at any time;
// drawing and mouse events are automatically adjusted to match
// what portion is visible, so you do not have to worry about scrolling
// in your event handlers. AreaHandler has more information.
//
// The internal coordinate system of an Area is points, which are
// floating-point and device-independent. For more details, see
// AreaHandler. The size of a scrolling Area must be an exact integer
// number of points (that is, you cannot have an Area that is 32.5
// points tall) and thus the parameters to NewScrollingArea and
// SetSize are ints. All other instances of points in parameters and
// structures (including sizes of drawn objects) are float64s.
